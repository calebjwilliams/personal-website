    "text": "Hello! I’m Caleb, a recent graduate from UCLA, now pursuing my Master’s in Finance at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.\nI’m passionate about using data-driven insights to solve real-world problems, from machine learning and NLP to predictive analytics and now financial markets. I especially enjoy projects that merge storytelling with data—whether it’s analyzing trends, building recommendation systems, or applying quantitative models to investment and risk management.\nBeyond academics, I enjoy learning new languages, going to concerts, and exploring cafes in new cities."
