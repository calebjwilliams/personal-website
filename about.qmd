title: "About Me"

Hello! I’m Caleb, a fourth-year undergraduate student at UCLA majoring in Statistics & Data Science.

I’m passionate about using data-driven insights to solve real-world problems, particularly in machine learning, NLP, and predictive analytics.

I love working on projects that blend storytelling with data—whether it's analyzing trends in movies, building recommendation systems, or exploring cutting-edge AI models.

Beyond academics, I enjoy learning new languages, going to concerts, and exploring cafes around LA!
